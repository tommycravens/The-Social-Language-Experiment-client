<h2>Description:<h2>
<body>
This application is version 1.0 of my language learning app, The Social Language Experiment. I have constructed both the front-end and back-end of this application. Version 1.0 of this app is set up for users to create index cards to beef up their vocabulary. When the user hears a word they are not familiar with they can jump into this app and add the word to their list of index cards. The user can add a definition, pronunciation, sentence and comfort level. After the card is created the user can then search for the card, update the card or delete the card once it has transitioned to their working lexicon.
